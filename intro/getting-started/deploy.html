	<h1>Deploy Vault</h1>
<p>Up to this point, we&#39;ve been working with the dev server, which
automatically authenticated us, setup in-memory storage, etc. Now that
you know the basics of Vault, it is important to learn how to deploy
Vault into a real environment.</p>
<p>On this page, we&#39;ll cover how to configure Vault, start Vault, the
seal/unseal process, and scaling Vault.</p>

<h2>Configuring Vault</h2>
<p>Vault is configured using <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a> files.
As a reminder, these files are also JSON-compatible. The configuration
file for Vault is relatively simple. An example is shown below:</p>
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="nx">backend</span> <span class="s2">"consul"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"demo.consul.io:80"</span>
  <span class="nx">path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"vault"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">listener</span> <span class="s2">"tcp"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="nx">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"127.0.0.1:8200"</span>
 <span class="nx">tls_disable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Within the configuration file, there are two primary configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>backend</code> - This is the physical backend that Vault uses for
storage. Up to this point the dev server has used &quot;inmem&quot; (in memory),
but in the example above we&#39;re using <a href="http://www.consul.io">Consul</a>,
a much more production-ready backend.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="listener"/><a href="#listener"><code>listener</code></a> - One or more listeners determine how Vault listens for
API requests. In the example above we&#39;re listening on localhost port
8200 without TLS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, copy and paste the configuration above. Change the <code>path</code>
for Consul to something unique for you to make sure you don&#39;t overlap
with anyone else following this guide. We&#39;ll use this demo cluster to
learn how to deploy Vault.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The demo consul cluster deletes its data every 30 minutes.
If this happens while you&#39;re learning to use Vault, you&#39;ll lose your data.
Just restart Vault and start over, knowing you have another 30 minutes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Starting the Server</h2>
<p>With the configuration in place, starting the server is simple, as
shown below. Modify the <code>-config</code> flag to point to the the proper path
where you saved the configuration above.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault server -config=example.hcl
==&gt; Vault server configuration:

         Log Level: info
           Backend: consul
        Listener 1: tcp (addr: "127.0.0.1:8200", tls: "disabled")

==&gt; Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
</code></pre>
<p>Vault outputs some information about its configuration, and then blocks.
This process should be run using a resource manager such as systemd or
upstart.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that you can&#39;t execute any commands. We don&#39;t have any
auth information! When you first setup a Vault server, you have to start
by <em>initializing</em> it.</p>

<h2>Initializing the Vault</h2>
<p>Initialization is the process of first configuring the Vault. This
only happens once when the server is started against a new backend that
has never been used with Vault before.</p>
<p>During initialization, the encryption keys are generated, unseal keys
are created, and the initial root token is setup. To initialize Vault
use <code>vault init</code>. This is an <em>unauthenticated</em> request, but it only works
on brand new Vaults with no data:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault init
Key 1: 427cd2c310be3b84fe69372e683a790e01
Key 2: 0e2b8f3555b42a232f7ace6fe0e68eaf02
Key 3: 37837e5559b322d0585a6e411614695403
Key 4: 8dd72fd7d1af254de5f82d1270fd87ab04
Key 5: b47fdeb7dda82dbe92d88d3c860f605005
Initial Root Token: eaf5cc32-b48f-7785-5c94-90b5ce300e9b

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3!

Please securely distribute the above keys. Whenever a Vault server
is started, it must be unsealed with 3 (the threshold)
of the keys above (any of the keys, as long as the total number equals
the threshold).

Vault does not store the original master key. If you lose the keys
above such that you no longer have the minimum number (the
threshold), then your Vault will not be able to be unsealed.
</code></pre>
<p>Initialization outputs two incredibly important pieces of information:
the <em>unseal keys</em> and the <em>initial root token</em>. This is the
<strong>only time ever</strong> that all of this data is known by Vault, and also the
only time that the unseal keys should ever be so close together.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this getting started guide, save all these keys
somewhere, and continue. In a real deployment scenario, you would never
save these keys together.</p>

<h2>Seal/Unseal</h2>
<p>Every initialized Vault server starts in the <em>sealed</em> state. From
the configuration, Vault can access the physical storage, but it can&#39;t
read any of it because it doesn&#39;t know how to decrypt it. The process
of teaching Vault how to decrypt the data is known as <em>unsealing</em> the
Vault.</p>
<p>Unsealing has to happen every time Vault starts. It can be done via
the API and via the command line. To unseal the Vault, you
must have the <em>threshold</em> number of unseal keys. In the output above,
notice that the &quot;key threshold&quot; is 3. This means that to unseal
the Vault, you need 3 of the 5 keys that were generated.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Vault does not store any of the unseal key shards. Vault
uses an algorithm known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing</a>
to split the master key into shards. Only with the threshold number of keys
can it be reconstructed and your data finally accessed.</p>
</div>
<p>Begin unsealing the Vault with <code>vault unseal</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault unseal
Key (will be hidden):
Sealed: true
Key Shares: 5
Key Threshold: 3
Unseal Progress: 1
</code></pre>
<p>After pasting in a valid key and confirming, you&#39;ll see that the Vault
is still sealed, but progress is made. Vault knows it has 1 key out of 3.
Due to the nature of the algorithm, Vault doesn&#39;t know if it has the
<em>correct</em> key until the threshold is reached.</p>
<p>Also notice that the unseal process is stateful. You can go to another
computer, use <code>vault unseal</code>, and as long as its pointing to the same server,
that other computer can continue the unseal process.. This is incredibly
important to the design of the unseal process: multiple people with multiple
keys are required to unseal the Vault. The Vault can be unsealed from
multiple computers and the keys should never be together. A single malicious
operator does not have enough keys to be malicious.</p>
<p>Continue with <code>vault unseal</code> to complete unsealing the Vault. Note that
all 3 keys must be different, but they can be any other keys. As long as
they&#39;re correct, you should soon see output like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault unseal
Key (will be hidden):
Sealed: false
Key Shares: 5
Key Threshold: 3
Unseal Progress: 0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Sealed: false</code> means the Vault is unsealed!</p>
<p>Feel free to play around with entering invalid keys, keys in different
orders, etc. in order to understand the unseal process. It is very important.
Once you&#39;re ready to move on, use <code>vault auth</code> to authenticate with
the root token.</p>
<p>As a root user, you can reseal the Vault with <code>vault seal</code>. A single
operator is allowed to do this. This lets a single operator lock down
the Vault in an emergency without consulting other operators.</p>
<p>When the Vault is sealed again, it clears all of its state (including
the encryption key) from memory. The Vault is secure and locked down
from access.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>You now know how to configure, initialize, and unseal/seal Vault.
This is the basic knowledge necessary to deploy Vault into a real
environment. Once the Vault is unsealed, you access it as you have
throughout this getting started guide (which worked with an unsealed Vault).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now know all the basics to get started with Vault.</p>
<p>Next, we have a page dedicated to
<a href="intro/getting-started/next-steps.html">next steps</a> depending on
what you&#39;d like to achieve.</p>

    <p>
        This tutorial is great for getting familiar with the command line
         interface to Vault. As soon as you opened this terminal, you connected to a real in-memory Vault server.
        Any commands you enter will work as they would with Vault normally, but leaving this page
        will end the session.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please note that this is running in a shared environment, so avoid setting any real secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Use the command "next" to move forward</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>This will work throughout
        the tutorial, along with "previous" to go back a step.
    </p>
</script>


<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="steps">
    <p>
        This tutorial will cover the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Initializing and unsealing your Vault</li>
        <li>- Authorizing your requests to Vault</li>
        <li>- Reading and writing secrets</li>
        <li>- Sealing your Vault</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Again, use "next" to move to the first step – initializing your Vault</strong>.
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="init">
    <p>
        To get started, we need to initialize an instance of Vault for you
        to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        While initializing, you can configure the seal behavior
        of Vault.
        </p>
    <p>
        Initialize Vault now, with 1 unseal key for simplicity, using the command:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll notice Vault prints out several keys here. Don't clear your terminal,
        as these are needed in the next few steps.
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="unseal">
    <p>
        When a Vault server is started, it starts in a sealed state.
         In this state, Vault is configured to know where and how to access the
         physical storage, but doesn't know how to decrypt any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vault encrypts data with an encryption key. This key is encrypted with the "master key", which
        isn't stored. Decrypting the master key requires a threshold of shards. In this example,
        we use one shard to decrypt this master key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unseal the Vault:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault unseal &lt;key 1&gt;</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="auth">
    <p>
        Before performing any operation with Vault, the
        connecting client must be authenticated. Authentication is
        the process of verifying a person or machine is who they say
        they are and assigning an identity to them. This identity is then
        used when making requests with Vault.
    </p>
    <p>
        For simplicity, we'll use the root token we generated on init in Step 2. This
        output should be available in the scrollback.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authorize with a client token:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault auth &lt;root token&gt;</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="secrets">
    <p>
        Now that Vault has been set-up, we can start reading and writing secrets
        with the default mounted secret backend. Secrets written to Vault
        are encrypted and then written to the backend storage.
        The backend storage mechanism never sees the unencrypted
        value and doesn't have the means necessary to decrypt
        it without Vault.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault write secret/hello value=world</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, you can then read this data too:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault read secret/hello</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="seal">
    <p>
        There is also an API to seal the Vault. This will throw
        away the encryption key and require another unseal process
        to restore it. Sealing only requires a single operator
        with root privileges. This is typically part of a rare "break glass
        procedure".
    </p>
    <p>
        This way, if there is a detected intrusion, the Vault data can be locked
        quickly to try to minimize damages. It can't be accessed again
        without access to the master key shards.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault seal</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="finish">
    <p>
        Thanks for trying out the Vault CLI. If you want to keep playing with
        commands, use "fu" to go fullscreen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the Vault CLI uses the HTTP API, which gives you full access to Vault. Every aspect
        of Vault can be controlled via this API.
    </p>
