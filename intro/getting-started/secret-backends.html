	<h1>Secret Backends</h1>
<p>Previously, we saw how to read and write arbitrary secrets to Vault.
To do this, we used the <code>secret/</code> prefix. This prefix specifies the
<em>secret backend</em> to use, and Vault defaults to mounting the <em>generic</em>
backend to <code>secret/</code>. The generic backend reads and writes raw data to
the backend storage.</p>
<p>Vault supports other backends in addition to &quot;generic&quot;, and this feature
in particular is what makes Vault unique. For example, the &quot;aws&quot; backend
generates AWS access keys dynamically, on demand. Another example --
this type of backend does not yet exist -- is a backend that
reads and writes data directly to an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">HSM</a>.
As Vault matures, more and more backends will be added.</p>
<p>To represent backends, Vault behaves much like a filesystem: backends
are <em>mounted</em> at specific paths. For example, the &quot;generic&quot; backend is
<em>mounted</em> at the <code>secret/</code> prefix.</p>
<p>On this page, we&#39;ll learn about the mount system and the operations
that can be performed with them. We do this as prerequisite knowledge
to the next page, where we&#39;ll create dynamic secrets.</p>

<h2>Mount a Backend</h2>
<p>To start, let&#39;s mount another &quot;generic&quot; backend. Just like a normal
filesystem, Vault can mount a backend multiple times at different
mount points. This is useful if you want different access control policies
(covered later) or configurations for different paths.</p>
<p>To mount the backend:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault mount generic
Successfully mounted 'generic' at 'generic'!
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the mount point will be the same name as the backend. This
is because 99% of the time, you don&#39;t want to customize this mount point.
In this example, we mounted the &quot;generic&quot; backend at <code>generic/</code>.</p>
<p>You can inspect mounts using <code>vault mounts</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault mounts
Path      Type     Description
generic/  generic
secret/   generic  generic secret storage
sys/      system   system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the <code>generic/</code> path we just mounted, as well as the built-in
secret path. You can also see the <code>sys/</code> path. We won&#39;t cover this in the
getting started guide, but this mount point is used to interact with
the Vault core system.</p>
<p>Spend some time reading and writing secrets to the new mount point to
convince yourself it works. As a bonus, write to the <code>secret/</code> endpoint
and observe that those values unavailable via <code>generic/</code>: they share the
same backend, but do not share any data. In addition to this, backends
(of the same type or otherwise) <em>cannot</em> access the data of other backends;
they can only access data within their mount point.</p>

<h2>Unmount a Backend</h2>
<p>Once you&#39;re sufficiently convinced mounts behave as you expect, you can
unmount it. When a backend is unmounted, all of its secrets are revoked
and its data is deleted. If either of these operations fail, the backend
remains mounted.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ vault unmount generic/
Successfully unmounted 'generic/'!
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to unmounting, you can <em>remount</em> a backend. Remounting a
backend changes its mount point. This is still a disruptive command: the
stored data is retained, but all secrets are revoked since secrets are
closely tied to their mount paths.</p>

<h2>What is a Secret Backend?</h2>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve mounted and unmounted a backend, you might wonder:
&quot;what is a secret backend? what is the point of this mounting system?&quot;</p>
<p>Vault behaves a lot like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system">virtual filesystem</a>.
The read/write/delete operations are forwarded to the backend, and the
backend can choose to react to these operations however it wishes.
For example, the &quot;generic&quot; backend simply passes this through to the
storage backend (after encrypting data first).</p>
<p>However, the &quot;aws&quot; backend (which you&#39;ll see soon), will read/write IAM
policies and access tokens. So, while you might do a <code>vault read aws/deploy</code>,
this isn&#39;t reading from any <em>physical</em> path &quot;aws/deploy&quot;. Instead, the AWS
backend is dynamically generating an access key based on the &quot;deploy&quot; policy.</p>
<p>This abstraction is incredibly powerful. It lets Vault interface directly
with physical systems such as the backend as well as things such as SQL
databases, HSMs, etc. But in addition to these physical systems, Vault
can interact with more unique environments: AWS IAM, dynamic SQL user creation,
etc. all using the same read/write interface.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>You now know about secret backends and how to operate on the mount table.
This is important knowledge to move forward and learn about other secret
backends.</p>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll use the
<a href="intro/getting-started/dynamic-secrets.html">AWS backend to generate dynamic secrets</a>.</p>

    <p>
        This tutorial is great for getting familiar with the command line
         interface to Vault. As soon as you opened this terminal, you connected to a real in-memory Vault server.
        Any commands you enter will work as they would with Vault normally, but leaving this page
        will end the session.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please note that this is running in a shared environment, so avoid setting any real secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Use the command "next" to move forward</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>This will work throughout
        the tutorial, along with "previous" to go back a step.
    </p>
</script>


<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="steps">
    <p>
        This tutorial will cover the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Initializing and unsealing your Vault</li>
        <li>- Authorizing your requests to Vault</li>
        <li>- Reading and writing secrets</li>
        <li>- Sealing your Vault</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Again, use "next" to move to the first step – initializing your Vault</strong>.
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="init">
    <p>
        To get started, we need to initialize an instance of Vault for you
        to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        While initializing, you can configure the seal behavior
        of Vault.
        </p>
    <p>
        Initialize Vault now, with 1 unseal key for simplicity, using the command:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll notice Vault prints out several keys here. Don't clear your terminal,
        as these are needed in the next few steps.
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="unseal">
    <p>
        When a Vault server is started, it starts in a sealed state.
         In this state, Vault is configured to know where and how to access the
         physical storage, but doesn't know how to decrypt any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vault encrypts data with an encryption key. This key is encrypted with the "master key", which
        isn't stored. Decrypting the master key requires a threshold of shards. In this example,
        we use one shard to decrypt this master key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unseal the Vault:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault unseal &lt;key 1&gt;</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="auth">
    <p>
        Before performing any operation with Vault, the
        connecting client must be authenticated. Authentication is
        the process of verifying a person or machine is who they say
        they are and assigning an identity to them. This identity is then
        used when making requests with Vault.
    </p>
    <p>
        For simplicity, we'll use the root token we generated on init in Step 2. This
        output should be available in the scrollback.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authorize with a client token:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault auth &lt;root token&gt;</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="secrets">
    <p>
        Now that Vault has been set-up, we can start reading and writing secrets
        with the default mounted secret backend. Secrets written to Vault
        are encrypted and then written to the backend storage.
        The backend storage mechanism never sees the unencrypted
        value and doesn't have the means necessary to decrypt
        it without Vault.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault write secret/hello value=world</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, you can then read this data too:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault read secret/hello</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="seal">
    <p>
        There is also an API to seal the Vault. This will throw
        away the encryption key and require another unseal process
        to restore it. Sealing only requires a single operator
        with root privileges. This is typically part of a rare "break glass
        procedure".
    </p>
    <p>
        This way, if there is a detected intrusion, the Vault data can be locked
        quickly to try to minimize damages. It can't be accessed again
        without access to the master key shards.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>vault seal</code>
    </p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="finish">
    <p>
        Thanks for trying out the Vault CLI. If you want to keep playing with
        commands, use "fu" to go fullscreen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the Vault CLI uses the HTTP API, which gives you full access to Vault. Every aspect
        of Vault can be controlled via this API.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend reading through the <a href="intro/index.html">intro guide</a> next, which will
        provide more background information, use cases and examples.
